    I'm old, and I have <strong>bold opinions</strong>. I would love to have a

    Feel free to interrupt me. <br />
    If the question is interesting, I will answer it for everyone's benefit.
    However, be prepared to be asked to wait until the end or continue the
    discussion off stage. We only have 40 minutes.
